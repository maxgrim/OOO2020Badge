title: Offensive Offsite Operation - badge edition
description: We are welcoming you to a journey beyond bytes and keyboards. The OOO crew is awaiting you onboard. To prove your faithful commitment to the rebellion and test your interstellar skills the captains have created a challenge for you. To some, this could look like to an ornament which can be controlled remotely, to others, it could be much more. It will be up to you to unlock all the capabilities of this device and try to obtain one of the keys to get on board. The keys will be distributed to the three best galactical maze-runners, turbojets py-coders, Xtensa unpackers, light transcoders, and speed fighters.

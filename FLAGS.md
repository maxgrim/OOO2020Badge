# Flag 10
Prompt: writeFlagToFS

You first have to download the FS, then add a file to it called "flag.txt", which is empty, and then, when restarting the badge, execute the writeFlagToFS command.

Then, the badge will write the contents to the filesystem, after which you can download the FS again, and parse the FS's contents.
